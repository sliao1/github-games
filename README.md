## Welcome to GitHub Games

A project based learning activity for people who are getting started with Git and GitHub.

You can play the game at: http://sliao1.github.io/github-games/

This is tetris! Spacebar to start the game, then arrow keys to move and rotate pieces.

Beware! The pieces drop faster the longer you play the game.
The goal is to create complete rows with no empty spaces.
Don't let the pieces stack up too high!

>> _*SUPPORTED BROWSERS*: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE9+_
